**Imagine a feature.**
- Try to imagine precisely what you want to add. It could be a layer name, a font or a theme.

**Describe in a brief paragraph.**
- Describe everything you want to add in a single or multiple paragraphs.

**Give yourself ideas to add to Gamma-Studios**
- Start making ideas with your mind. [e.g. I want to add the meta to a tab like Automators, Volatility, Aleph and Restack. You needed to reach lowercase ya to unlock it.]
- If you know how to code, then go to the [..] file and add the deserved idea.
- If you don't know how to code, ask your brother/sister that knows.
